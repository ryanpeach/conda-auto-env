# conda-auto-env for zsh

Automatically activate a conda environment when entering a folder with an environment.yml file.

If the environment doesn't exist, conda-auto-env creates it and activates it for you.

This functionality was inspired by [conda auto activate](https://github.com/sotte/conda_auto_activate), [virtualenv auto activate](https://gist.github.com/garyjohnson/394c58e22a2adfa103e2) and [autoenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv).

## Install

add `conda-auto-env` to your zsh plugins list. It's that simple!
